# Stories of Success — One-Page Site (GitHub Pages)

## What this is
A single-page site styled to match the navy/gold postcard look.

## Quick publish (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (example: `stories-of-success`).
2. Upload the contents of this folder to the repo root:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/success-story-photo.jpg`
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main` (root)
4. Wait for the Pages URL to appear (typically: `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`).

## Update content
Edit `index.html` and replace the story text as needed.

## QR Code workflow
1. Paste your GitHub Pages URL into Bitly to create a short link.
2. Generate a QR code from the Bitly link.
3. Place the QR on the postcard and test-scan it.
